                          <p>Vibrand Quant offers the hallmark Vibrand experience and Client service, along with a broad array of quantitative tools.
                          We pride ourselves in providing bespoke Quantitative solutions, meaning we’ll never box you into a ‘model’: every study we design is based on its own merits and your individual needs. </p>

We employ a variety of methods/ modules, each with their own statistical tools. </p><p>
Modules can be used on their own or in conjunction with some or all other modules. We assemble our modules based on project specific research needs.
Each module has a number of advanced statistical analysis tools to reach its aim, which in some cases overlap with other modules.
In processing and reporting on our findings we focus strongly on providing you with actionable, strategic insights.

<p>Field has  always been the Achilles Heel of quant research – and we insist on being absolutely certain of the accuracy of our data.
Consequently, we employ BOTH hands on supervision AND state of the art tech in our process – offering a blend of efficiency and reliability. This ‘best of both worlds’ approach is at competitive cost. </p><p>
Our tech allows for complete digital management of the process – with GPS tracking of our field teams, data captured in real time, several layers of quality control (including randomised audio recording), randomised questioning (where appropriate) and automated quotas.
</p><p>The hands on component sees an executive member of Vibrand deployed into field, and working with our field heads throughout the process.
This adds a layer of management level supervision few other agencies provide.</p><p>
It ensures daily interaction with our field team, daily updates from our interviewers – allowing for in-field tweaks to questionnaires or briefing instructions, and qualitative feedback from the interviewers to client on a daily basis. </p><p>
This approach has made field quicker, better and more reliable than ever before – never again do you have to sit in a presentation and quietly wonder whether the data you are seeing is reliable.
</p>
<p>We also offer state of the art sensory research. Our sister company, <a href="http://thetestingpanel.co.za" target="_blank">The Testing Panel</a> uses sensory statistical tools in sensory, concept and pack work.</p><p>

Operationally, our Qual and Quant departments do not exist in separate silos; we work closely together and provide a seamless and integrated full service research offering.</p><p>

Our Quant methodologies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAPI (Computer Aided Personal Interviews via face to face surveys)</li>
<li>CATI (Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews via phone call surveys)</li>
<li>Online Surveys via a respondent panel or client list</li>
<li>Central Venue Location interviews</li>
</ul>
